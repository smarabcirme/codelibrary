A captive portal is a web page that users have to interact with before they can access the Internet. It can be used for various purposes, such as displaying terms of use, collecting user information, or advertising products or services. In this article, we will show you how to create a captive portal for your Raspberry Pi Wi-Fi access point using nodogsplash, a lightweight and customizable software.

## What You Need
 
- A Raspberry Pi with Wi-Fi and Ethernet capabilities
- A power supply for your Raspberry Pi
- An Ethernet cable
- A monitor, a keyboard, and an HDMI cable
- A Wi-Fi network that you can connect to

## Step 1: Update Your Raspberry Pi
 
Before we start, we need to make sure that our Raspberry Pi is up to date. Connect your Raspberry Pi to a power source and a monitor using the HDMI cable. Connect a keyboard to your Raspberry Pi and an Ethernet cable to your router. Open a terminal window and run the following commands:

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt upgrade
    sudo reboot

This will update your system and reboot your Raspberry Pi.
 
## Step 2: Install nodogsplash
 
Nodogsplash is a software that allows you to create a captive portal for your Wi-Fi access point. It is easy to install and configure, and it supports various authentication methods and customization options. To install nodogsplash, run the following commands in the terminal:

    sudo apt install git libmicrohttpd-dev build-essential
    cd ~
    git clone https://github.com/nodogsplash/nodogsplash.git
    cd nodogsplash
    make
    sudo make install

This will download, compile, and install nodogsplash on your Raspberry Pi.
 
## Step 3: Configure nodogsplash
 
Nodogsplash has a configuration file located at `/etc/nodogsplash/nodogsplash.conf`. You can edit this file using any text editor, such as nano. To open the file with nano, run the following command:

    sudo nano /etc/nodogsplash/nodogsplash.conf

In this file, you can change various settings for your captive portal, such as the interface name, the gateway name, the splash page URL, the authentication method, the redirect URL, and more. For example, you can change the following lines:

    # GatewayInterface br0
    GatewayInterface wlan0
    
    # GatewayName NoDogSplash
    GatewayName MyCaptivePortal
    
    # SplashPage splash.html
    SplashPage my_splash.html
    
    # AuthenticationMethod none
    AuthenticationMethod username_email
    
    # RedirectURL http://google.com
    RedirectURL http://mywebsite.com

This will set your Wi-Fi interface as the gateway interface, change the name of your captive portal, use a custom splash page, require users to enter their username and email address to access the Internet, and redirect them to your website after authentication. You can find more details about the configuration options in the [nodogsplash.conf file](https://github.com/nodogsplash/nodogsplash/blob/master/resources/nodogsplash.conf) or in the [nodogsplash documentation](https://nodogsplashdocs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
 
## Step 4: Create Your Splash Page
 
The splash page is the web page that users will see when they connect to your Wi-Fi access point. You can create your own splash page using HTML and CSS, or use one of the examples provided by nodogsplash. The splash page should be located in `/etc/nodogsplash/htdocs/`. For example, you can create a file named `my_splash.html` with the following content:

    <html>
    <head>
    <title>Welcome to My Captive Portal</title>
    <style>
    body {
      font-family: 8cf37b1e13
