## What is Egpu Setup 1.x.epub?
 
Egpu Setup 1.x.epub is a software created by nando4, an eGPU expert who has been involved with eGPUs since 2009. It is distributed only from eGPU.io by its creator. Some systems cannot use an eGPU without it. Typically, you may need Egpu Setup 1.x.epub if you:
 
- encounter Windows error 12:cannot allocate resources requiring PCI compaction
- want to set PCIe 1.1 Gen1 (2.5GT/s) or PCIe 2.0 Gen2 (5GT/s) link speed (2nd-gen i-core or newer CPUs)
- require ability to detect your eGPU in a pre-boot environment
- want to load a DSDT override without engaging Windows test signing mode
- want to disable a dGPU in a hybrid graphics system to free up resources to host the eGPU
- want to disable a dGPU in a hybrid graphics system to activate NVidia Optimus and if using a x1 link, engage x1 pci-e compression
- want to initialize a NVidia video card prior to Windows boot to prevent hang/BSOD on startup or error 43 in device Manager. Eliminates the need for a standby, attach, resume to overcome this problem.
- want to use x1E/x2E/x2/x4 higher performance PCIe links (core2duo and 1st gen i-core CPUs only)
